# Resource-Analysis-Corn

The Resource Analysis of Corn Yield project is conducted to fulfill the final assignment for the Data Science Bootcamp by GSB in collaboration with Dibimbing.id. This project focuses on analyzing various environmental and resource-based factors influencing corn yield. The primary objective is to identify which features have the greatest impact on corn yield, allowing for more informed decisions in agricultural planning and resource allocation.

The objective is to build a data-driven model that analyzes key factors affecting corn yield and determines which features contribute most significantly to yield outcomes. By utilizing data science and statistical analysis techniques, the project aims to provide insights that could support optimized farming strategies and improve yield predictions.

Code features:
- Collection and preprocessing of corn yield-related data, including soil quality, rainfall, temperature, fertilizer usage, and other relevant factors.
- Development of a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to assess feature importance.
- Feature importance analysis to determine which factors have the highest correlation with corn yield.
- Visualization of results to highlight the primary contributors to yield, aiding in effective decision-making for resource management.
